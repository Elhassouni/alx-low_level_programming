# C Library Basics and Usage

Welcome to the world of C libraries! This README is your gateway to understanding the purpose, creation, and usage of C libraries. Get ready to unlock the power of reusable code and elevate your C programming skills! ✨

## What's a C Library?

Imagine having a toolbox filled with ready-to-use tools for your C projects. That's precisely what a C library is! It's a collection of pre-written, compiled functions that you can directly integrate into your programs, saving valuable time and effort compared to writing everything from scratch.

### Benefits of C Libraries:

- **Code Reusability:** No need to reinvent the wheel. Libraries like `stdio.h` (for input/output) and `math.h` (for mathematical operations) provide commonly used functions for direct integration.
  
- **Modularity:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions, promoting cleaner and more organized code.
  
- **Time Savings:** Leverage existing, tested code to focus on the unique aspects of your project, accelerating development.

## Building Your Own C Library: ⚒️

Let's embark on creating a static library named `libsample.a` with two useful functions: `add` and `subtract`.

1. **Compile Source Files:**
   ```bash
   gcc -c add.c subtract.c
   ```
   This generates object files (`add.o`, `subtract.o`) with the compiled code of your functions.

2. **Create the Archive:**
   ```bash
   ar rcs libsample.a add.o subtract.o
   ```
   Use the `ar` tool to combine object files into a single archive named `libsample.a`.

3. **Using Your Library:**

   Incorporate your library into a C program:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include "libsample.h" // Include your library header

   int main() {
     int result_add = add(5, 3);
     printf("5 + 3 = %d\n", result_add);

     int result_subtract = subtract(10, 2);
     printf("10 - 2 = %d\n", result_subtract);

     return 0;
   }
   ```

   Compile and run:

   ```bash
   gcc -o my_program my_program.c -L. -lsample
   ./my_program
   ```

   Expect the output:

   ```
   5 + 3 = 8
   10 - 2 = 8
   ```

## Understanding Static vs. Dynamic Libraries:

C provides two types of libraries: static and dynamic. 

### Static Linking:

- **Process:** During compilation, the entire code from static libraries is included directly in the executable.
  
- **Outcome:** Produces standalone executables with no external dependencies at runtime.

### Dynamic Linking:

- **Process:** At runtime, dynamic libraries are loaded into memory by the operating system's dynamic loader.
  
- **Outcome:** The program's executable doesn't contain the library code, allowing efficient use of disk space and facilitating easy updates.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this tutorial, you should:

- Understand the concept and benefits of C libraries.
- Create and utilize your own static library.
- Differentiate between static and dynamic libraries.

## Deepen Your Knowledge:

### Practice Exercises:

1. Modify the `add` function to handle three numbers instead of two.
2. Create a new function in your library for multiplication.
