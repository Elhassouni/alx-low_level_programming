# Building and Using "C" Libraries 🛠️

## Simplifying Complex Programs

As your programs grow, managing compilation and linking becomes challenging. Break down your source code into smaller, manageable units using separate makefiles, promoting collaboration among different programmers in larger projects.

## Understanding "C" Libraries 📚

Compilers provide a crucial tool: **libraries**. A library is a file containing multiple object files, treated as a single entity during the program's linking phase. Indexed libraries make it easy to find symbols like functions and variables, speeding up the linking process by reducing the number of files the compiler needs to search and open.

In the realm of Unix systems and many modern platforms, two types of libraries exist – **static** and **shared (or dynamic)** libraries.

- **Static Libraries:** 🧱 Collections of object files linked directly into the program during compilation's linking phase. They are not relevant during runtime, resulting in a self-contained executable.

- **Dynamic Libraries (Shared Libraries):** 🔄 Linked in two stages. During compile time, the linker verifies that required symbols are either linked into the program or in shared libraries. During runtime, a dynamic loader checks and loads the necessary shared libraries into memory.

### Clarification on Library Functions at Runtime 🤔

**Static Libraries:**
In the context of static libraries, the entire code is physically included in the executable during compilation, making the program a self-contained unit with all necessary functions.

**Dynamic Libraries:**
In contrast, dynamic libraries are not physically copied into the executable. Instead, the dynamic loader loads the required shared libraries into memory during runtime, allowing the program to access the library functions without direct incorporation.

### Explanation of Static and Dynamic Linking 📚

**Static Linking:** 🛠️
This occurs at compile-time, where the linker combines the object code of program modules and libraries into a single executable file. While resulting in larger binaries, it ensures independence and self-sufficiency, potentially requiring recompilation for library updates.

**Dynamic Linking:** 🔄
Taking place at runtime, dynamic linking embeds references to shared libraries without including their code in the executable. The dynamic loader loads these libraries into memory during program startup, leading to efficient disk space and memory use. It also supports easier library updates without recompiling the entire program and the concept of shared libraries.

## Creating a Simple "C" Library 🧰

### Step 1: Creating a Static Library

Imagine you have useful tools in files named `util_file.c`, `util_net.c`, and `util_math.c`. Create a static library named `libutil.a` with the following commands:

```bash
gcc -c util_file.c util_net.c util_math.c
ar rcs libutil.a util_file.o util_net.o util_math.o
```

This static library now contains your tools.

### Step 2: Using Your Library in a Program

Assuming you have a file named `main.c`, compile and run your program like this:

```bash
gcc -o my_program main.c -L. -lutil
./my_program
```

This links your `main.c` with the `libutil.a` library.

## Key Takeaways:

- **Static Libraries:** 🧱 Your program contains all necessary tools, creating a self-contained executable.

- **Dynamic Libraries:** 🔄 Tools are loaded during program startup, saving memory and disk space.

- **Creating a Library:** 🧰 Utilize the `ar` tool to create a static library. Optionally, use `ranlib` to update the library index.

- **Using a Library:** 🛠️ Link your program with the library using `-L.` and `-lutil`.

Remember, libraries simplify your coding journey, providing organized and reusable code for smoother development! 🚀
