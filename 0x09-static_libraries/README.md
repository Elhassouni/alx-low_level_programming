# C Library Basics and Usage 📚

## What Is A “C” Library? What Is It Good For? 🧰

A "C" library is a collection of pre-compiled functions and routines that can be used by programs written in the C programming language. These libraries provide reusable code and help programmers avoid reinventing the wheel for common tasks.

### Benefits of Using C Libraries:

- **Code Reusability:** Libraries provide a set of functions that can be reused in multiple programs. ♻️
  
- **Modularity:** Libraries encourage modular programming by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions. 🧩

- **Time Savings:** Using libraries saves time by leveraging existing, tested code. ⌛

## Creating A Static “C” Library Using `ar` and `ranlib` 🏗️

### Static Library Overview:

A static library is linked directly into the executable during the compilation process, resulting in a standalone binary.

### Steps to Create a Static Library:

1. **Compile Source Files:**
   ```bash
   gcc -c file1.c file2.c
   ```

2. **Create Archive:**
   ```bash
   ar rcs libsample.a file1.o file2.o
   ```

3. **Update Archive Index (Optional):**
   ```bash
   ranlib libsample.a
   ```

## Using A “C” Library In A Program 🚀

### Linking with a Static Library:

1. **Compile Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o my_program my_program.c -L. -lsample
   ```

2. **Run Program:**
   ```bash
   ./my_program
   ```

## Difference Between Dynamic and Static Libraries (Static and Dynamic Linking) 🔄

### Static Linking:

- **Process:** Static linking is performed during the compilation process.
  
- **Outcome:** The entire code from the static library is physically included in the executable, creating a self-contained program.

- **Advantages:** 
  - Produces standalone executables.
  - No external dependencies at runtime.

### Dynamic Linking:

- **Process:** Dynamic linking is performed at runtime by the operating system's dynamic loader.
  
- **Outcome:** The program's executable does not contain the code from the dynamic library. Instead, the necessary library functions are loaded into memory during program startup.

- **Advantages:**
  - Shared libraries allow efficient use of disk space and memory.
  - Facilitates easy library updates without recompiling the program.

## Man Pages and Help:

### `ar` - Archive manipulation 🗃️

```bash
man ar
```

### `ranlib` - Generate index to archive 📇

```bash
man ranlib
```

### `nm` - List symbols from object files 📜

```bash
man nm
```

## Learning Objectives 🎓

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google: ...

## Clarification on Library Functions at Runtime 🤔

### Static Libraries:

In the context of static libraries, the entire code from the library is physically included in the executable during compilation. This means that the program becomes a self-contained unit, containing all the necessary functions.

### Dynamic Libraries:

Contrastingly, dynamic libraries are not physically copied into the executable. Instead, during runtime, the dynamic loader loads the required shared libraries into memory and attaches them to the running program. This allows the program to access the library functions without incorporating them directly into the executable.
