## Introduction

Memory allocation is a crucial aspect of programming, allowing dynamic storage allocation during runtime. In C, four primary functions facilitate memory management: `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`.

## malloc

### Prototype:

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

- `size`: Number of bytes to allocate.

`malloc` stands for memory allocation. It dynamically allocates a specified number of bytes and returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated block. The allocated memory is uninitialized.

## free

### Prototype:

```c
void free(void *ptr);
```

- `ptr`: Pointer to the memory block to free.

`free` is used to deallocate memory previously allocated by `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. It doesn't change the value of the pointer; instead, it marks the memory as available for future allocations.

## calloc

### Prototype:

```c
void *calloc(size_t num_elements, size_t element_size);
```

- `num_elements`: Number of elements to allocate memory for.
- `element_size`: Size of each element in bytes.

`calloc` (contiguous allocation) allocates a block of memory for an array of elements, each initialized to zero. It takes the number of elements and the size of each element as arguments.

## realloc

### Prototype:

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size);
```

- `ptr`: Pointer to the previously allocated memory block.
- `new_size`: New size in bytes.

`realloc` (reallocate) changes the size of the memory block pointed to by `ptr` to the specified `new_size`. It may move the block to a new location, and the content of the block is preserved up to the minimum of the old and new sizes.

## Usage Examples
